      CHR.js is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for <a href="#CHR">Constraint Handling Rules</a>, embedded in JavaScript. For better runtime performance it supports ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation too, either by its command line tool <code>chrjs</code> or <a href="https://github.com/fnogatz/babel-plugin-chr">babel-plugin-chr</a>, a plugin for <a href="http://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>.

      <a href="http://constraint-handling-rules.org/">Constraint Handling Rules</a> - for short CHR - is a declarative, rule-based language extension. Originally created in the early 1990s to implement new constraint solvers in a high level programming language, it has its origins in the logic and constraint programming. Today CHR is used as a general-purpose programming language with a wide range of applications. Besides this CHR implementation in JavaScript there are CHR systems for Prolog, Java, C, Haskell and <a href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/CHR/download.shtml">other popular programming languages</a>.
